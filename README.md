# Sitecore Protobuf Browser

Sitecore uses Protobuf to store the original/default contents of databases to the disk in these paths which are defined in the databases configs:

- ./App_Data/items/core/items.core.dat
- ./App_Data/items/master/items.master.dat
- ./App_Data/items/web/items.web.dat

Protobuf is a google based serializer: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf which is quite fast.

Here I have created a wpf app which allows you to browse this serialized files and check their contents.
You can choose multiple files and items in the secondary files (none O.O.B) will be shown in red in the content tree, which means they are overwritten or are new in the secondary files.

The fields in parentheses are added manually for information purposes  (ex. Item id, item path).


You need to select one of the original files listed above, with/without corresponding secondary file(s).

### Filtering:
In this example if you have selected "items.master.spe.dat" and "items.master.dat", by clicking the "Hide primary files" checkbox,
you can filter down the tree to show almost only the items from the powershell module:

## Important note
Sitecore modules and basically secondary files are kind of sparse tree, that means they do not include the whole tree of the master/core/web database.
because of that you need to always have a relevant data at hand(ex. items.master.dat) and select it with the relevant module.

### Limitations:
- There is no post processing or evaluating the inheritance chain or standard values. It simply reads what is stored in the .dat files.
- There is no version selector (Latest version is used)
- There is no language selector (only English version of items is shown)
- No search capabilities in place

Project is based on .net 4.8 sdk style with xmcloud assemblies are used in project. feel free to change them to sitecore kernel and build it.

### Change log
- Context menu for field section is added to provide easier copy
